# IDRB Lab
The Lab of Innovative Drug Research and Bioinformatics (IDRB) is a subordinate laboratory of College of Pharmaceutical Sciences (CPS) in Zhejiang University (ZJU), Hangzhou, China. IDRB aims at promoting the traditional lock-and-key paradigm in drug discovery to a more complex network pharmacology, which uses rationally designed synergistic interventions to treat complex diseases, especially the ones that are yet intractable or poorly managed. Currently, IDRB focus on designing multi-target drugs for treating cancer, major depression and other sophisticated indications. Moreover, we have started collaboration with renowned synthetic chemists to synthesize computationally verified virtual hits, and are seeking cooperation with biologists to test in-vitro and in-vivo activities.
